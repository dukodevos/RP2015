abstract = {Inferring the implicit price of an environmental good hinges on ceteris paribus conditions that are often hard to justify. This paper uses an unexpected change in flight regulations as source of exogenous variation and identifies aircraft noise effects from price adjustments in the market for rental apartments. Controlling for spatial and apartment heterogeneity, we find that aircraft noise reduces apartment rents by about 0.5\% per decibel. Our results indicate (i) that noise discounts are overestimated in cross-sectional studies because aircraft noise tends to be negatively correlated with omitted neighborhood and housing amenities and (ii) that noise effects are unlikely to be constant over the entire noise range.

abstract = {A class of differentiated products is completely described by a vector of objectively measured characteristics. Observed product prices and the specific amounts of characteristics associated with each good define a set of implicit or "hedonic" prices. A theory of hedonic prices is formulated as a problem in the economics of spatial equilibrium in which the entire set of implicit prices guides both consumer and producer locational decisions in characteristics space. Buyer and seller choices, as well as the meaning and nature of market equilibrium, are analyzed. Empirical implications for hedonic price regressions and index number con- struction are pointed out.},

abstract = {Inhabitants of houses near Amsterdam Airport are complaining of noise nuisance, caused by aircraft traffic. The usual assumption is that the effect of the externality will be perfectly reflected by house price differentials. This is based on the implicit assumption that there is a well-functioning housing market. If that is not true, we need a correction method in order to assess the intangible damage. We assess the monetary value of the noise damage, caused by aircraft noise nuisance around Amsterdam Airport as the sum of hedonic price differentials and a residual cost component. The residual costs are assessed from a survey, including an ordinal life satisfaction scale, on which individual respondents have scored. The derived compensation scheme depends on, among other things, the objective noise level, income, the degree to which prices account for noise differences, and the presence of noise insulation.},

abstract = {In attempting to simulate the operation of a dynamic route guidance system, the modelling task is concerned both with the operation of the control system and with the implications this has for modelling driver behaviour (whether or not the driver is receiving information from the controller) and network conditions. The aim of this paper is to provide an overview of the modelling issues which need to be considered when addressing such a problem, and which have been identified by various authors in reports on experimental/survey work and in discussion papers. In discussing the great number of challenges to the modelling world which have arisen from the interest in such systems, we seek to stimulate further discussion and to provide a framework within which any route guidance model may be critically evaluated. We consider such a framework to be particularly timely in the light of the wealth of simulation models currently being proposed - and widely varying conclusions being drawn - as a result of many major research initiatives currently underway throughout the developed world. It is our belief that the development of a model which adequately represents the performance of a dynamic route guidance system is of the utmost importance to the success of such an approach. It will not only provide a means for evaluating the potential benefits, but should also provide an essential insight into the most appropriate means for its implementation and improve our understanding of transportation networks.},

abstract = {Value estimates for environmental goods can be obtained by either estimating preference parameters as "revealed" through behavior related to some aspect of the amenity or using "stated" information concerning preferences for the good. In the environmental economics literature the stated preference approach has come to be known as "contingent valuation" as the "valuation" estimated obtained from preference information given the respondent is said to be "contingent" on the details of the "constructed market" for the environmental good put forth in the survey. Work on contingent valuation now typically comprises the largest single group of papers at major environmental economics conferences and in several of the leading journals in the field. As such, it is impossible to "review" the literature per se or even cover all of the major papers in the area in some detail. Instead, in this chapter we seek to provide a coherent overview of the main issues and how they fit together. The organization of the chapter is as follows. First, we provide an overview of the history of contingent valuation starting with its antecedents and foundational papers and then trace its subsequent development using several broad themes. Second, we put forth the theoretical foundations of contingent valuation with particular emphasis on ties to standard measures of economic welfare. Third, we look at the issue of existence/passive use considerations. Fourth, we consider the relationship of contingent valuation to information on preferences that can be obtained by observing revealed behavior and how the two sources of information might be combined. Fifth, we look at different ways in which preference information can be elicited in a CV survey, paying particular attention to the incentive structure posed by different elicitation formats. Sixth, we turn to econometric issues associated with these different elicitation formats. Seventh, we briefly consider survey design issues. Eighth, we look at issues related to survey administration and extrapolating the results obtained to the population of interest. Ninth, we describe the major controversies related to the use of contingent valuation and summarize the evidence. Finally, we provide some thoughts on where we think contingent valuation is headed in the future. ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},
