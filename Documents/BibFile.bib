abstract = {Inferring the implicit price of an environmental good hinges on ceteris paribus conditions that are often hard to justify. This paper uses an unexpected change in flight regulations as source of exogenous variation and identifies aircraft noise effects from price adjustments in the market for rental apartments. Controlling for spatial and apartment heterogeneity, we find that aircraft noise reduces apartment rents by about 0.5\% per decibel. Our results indicate (i) that noise discounts are overestimated in cross-sectional studies because aircraft noise tends to be negatively correlated with omitted neighborhood and housing amenities and (ii) that noise effects are unlikely to be constant over the entire noise range. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {In attempting to simulate the operation of a dynamic route guidance system, the modelling task is concerned both with the operation of the control system and with the implications this has for modelling driver behaviour (whether or not the driver is receiving information from the controller) and network conditions. The aim of this paper is to provide an overview of the modelling issues which need to be considered when addressing such a problem, and which have been identified by various authors in reports on experimental/survey work and in discussion papers. In discussing the great number of challenges to the modelling world which have arisen from the interest in such systems, we seek to stimulate further discussion and to provide a framework within which any route guidance model may be critically evaluated. We consider such a framework to be particularly timely in the light of the wealth of simulation models currently being proposed - and widely varying conclusions being drawn - as a result of many major research initiatives currently underway throughout the developed world. It is our belief that the development of a model which adequately represents the performance of a dynamic route guidance system is of the utmost importance to the success of such an approach. It will not only provide a means for evaluating the potential benefits, but should also provide an essential insight into the most appropriate means for its implementation and improve our understanding of transportation networks.},

In the environmental economics literature the stated preference approach has come to be known as "contingent valuation" as the "valuation" estimated obtained from preference information given the respondent is said to be "contingent" on the details of the "constructed market" for the environmental good put forth in the survey. Work on contingent valuation now typically comprises the largest single group of papers at major environmental economics conferences and in several of the leading journals in the field.

First, we provide an overview of the history of contingent valuation starting with its antecedents and foundational papers and then trace its subsequent development using several broad themes. Second, we put forth the theoretical foundations of contingent valuation with particular emphasis on ties to standard measures of economic welfare. Third, we look at the issue of existence/passive use considerations. Fourth, we consider the relationship of contingent valuation to information on preferences that can be obtained by observing revealed behavior and how the two sources of information might be combined. Fifth, we look at different ways in which preference information can be elicited in a CV survey, paying particular attention to the incentive structure posed by different elicitation formats.

Eighth, we look at issues related to survey administration and extrapolating the results obtained to the population of interest.

Moreover, according to EU-guidelines, determination and enforcement of differentiated noise limits will be delegated from national to local governments in the near future. The value of noise has never been this important. In this paper, we estimate the non-linear impact of traffic noise on property prices. The used data set is very extensive; over 100,000 sales transactions are studied, with many individual property characteristics, combined with noise levels for 2 million small 100 by 100 m areas. We use spatial autocorrelation techniques to overcome the regular problems of traditional NIMBY-analysis performed by hedonic regression. In a rising market, we find that the impact of traffic noise ranges to 12 percent, with an average of about 5 percent. The discount varies across sub-markets, and is a non-linear function of the noise level.},

abstract = {In this study, the acceptability of different transport policy measures was examined. Three measures were assessed individually and as packages combining one push measure (a raised tax on fossil fuel) and one pull measure (in Package 1 improved public transport and in Package 2 a subsidy of renewable fuel). To analyze factors important for the acceptability, we proposed a model where the value-belief-norm theory combined with policy specific beliefs (perceived fairness and perceived effectiveness) predicted acceptability. Furthermore, we examined whether problem awareness or personal norm was more important for acceptability. In a questionnaire study conducted in Sweden, a sample of car users (N = 616) assessed the transport policy measures. Results showed that while the pull measures were perceived to be effective, fair, and acceptable, the push measure and the packages were perceived to be rather ineffective, unfair, and unacceptable. The proposed model was supported for the measures and problem awareness was found to have a direct effect on acceptability for the pull measures while personal norm was found to have a direct effect on acceptability for the push measure and the two policy packages. In addition, perceived fairness and effectiveness were found to be particularly important for acceptability. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

After a literature review, some general results of a project on the support for transport policy measures in the Netherlands are discussed. Next, a statistical analysis of opinions of various relevant subgroups of citizens is carried out. It appears that safety problems are considered most important from an individual point of view, while environmental problems are most severe from a social point of view. Measures with small direct effects on the behaviour of respondents are generally regarded as most effective by the respondents. The support for safety measures is highest, while perceived problems and effectiveness as well as personal features also influence the support for policy measures. It is concluded that the social support for transport policy measures and packages can be increased by attending to these underlying factors.},
